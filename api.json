      "summary": "A vampiric firefly spirit from Ewe people (Ghana, Togo) that drinks blood, especially from children, and can possess humans. In spirit form appears as firefly, in possessed human form acts as vampire.",
      "full": "The Adze is a vampiric creature from the Ewe people of Ghana and Togo in West Africa. In its spirit form, it manifests as a firefly or glowing light that appears at night. The adze seeks sleeping victims to drink their blood, with a particular preference for children. It has the ability to possess humans, and when possessing someone, that person becomes vampiric in behavior. The adze drinks blood, spreads disease, and causes death. Detection involves spotting firefly lights at night that may indicate an adze seeking victims. Traditional protections and medicines are used by the Ewe people to ward against the adze. This creature represents an African variant of vampire folklore, distinctly different from European vampires in its spirit-based nature and firefly manifestation. The belief is part of Ewe traditional folklore and cultural heritage."
